lll-mode.el
===============

By Rob Myers <rob@robyers.org>

Emacs support for editing Ethereum Low Level Language code.


Installation
============

To install the Emacs major mode, add the file lll-mode.el to your Emacs
load path. You can then load it by typing the following in Emacs:

 M-x lll-mode

Alternatively you can have Emacs load it automatically for files with a .lll
extension by adding the following to your .emacs file:
 
(require 'lll-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.lll$" . lll-mode))

Electric Mode
=============

lll-mode works well with electric-pair mode from Emacs 24.1.
To enable electric pair mode either:

M-x electric-pair-mode

or add the following to your .emacs file:

(add-hook 'lll-mode-hook 'electric-pair-mode)
